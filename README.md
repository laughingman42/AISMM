# AI Security Maturity Model
 
 The AISMM v1.1 provides a comprehensive, standards-aligned maturity model for organizations to assess and advance their AI security posture across three integrated domains: Security for AI (protecting AI systems throughout their lifecycle), Security with AI (deploying AI as a security capability), and Security from AI (managing AI-specific risks and harms). This version incorporates guidance from:
    
    - NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 2.0) and Generative AI Profile (NIST AI 600-1)
    - EU AI Act
    - ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Management Systems)
    - OWASP GenAI Security initiatives
